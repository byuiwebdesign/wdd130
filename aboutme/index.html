   <h2>Olivia Dickson</h2>
   <p>Hi! My name is Olivia Dickson. I am majoring in graphic design. I enjoy traveling, doing things outdoors, and spending time with my family. I also enjoy doing watercolor and am looking forward to starting an Etsy shop in the near future! 
   </p>
   <p> One thing I like about BYU-Idaho is the flexibility to take classes online. I am taking this course because I thought it would give me good knowlede and skills to use in my design career.  </p>
